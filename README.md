Student ID Scanner

This project started when I was late to school one day and noticed the arbitarily long amount of time it takes for a student to sign into school. 'Sign in' is currently done using a google form that takes every student about a minute to fill out. This isn't a problem when just a few student show up late; however, our current situation is as follows: let's say 5 (A-E) students show up right at 9:05 and must fill out the form.

This thing will include code for scanning IDs, circuits, and 3d files for the scanner
